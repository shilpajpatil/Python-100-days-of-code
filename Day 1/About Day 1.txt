
# I have used Module from python 
	-> A file containing Python code, for e.g.: Addition.py, is called a module and its module 
	   name would be Addition. 
	-> We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized 
	   files. 
	-> Modules provide reusability of code. 
	-> We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying 
	   their definitions into different programs.
	-> To import our defined module Addition we type the following in the Python 
		prompt. 
 		import Addition
	->This does not enter the names of the functions defined in example directly in the current 
	  symbol table. 
	->It only enters the module name example there. 
	-> Using the module name we can access the function using dot (.) operation. 
	   Addition    .   addition()
		|             |
	     (moduleName)   (Function Name)

#Addition Module
	-> In this module i have created a calculator where if you have pass two number to a function it 
	   will print addition ,subtraction , Multiplication , and division
#Factorial of a number 
	-> It will find the factorial of a number 
        -> e.g. 5!=5*4*3*2*1 = 120

# Factors of number 
 	-> if will find the factors of that number and store it inside the list and 
	   disply that list 
        -> factors of e.g. 6 = [1,2,3,6]
