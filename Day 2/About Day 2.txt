1. First I solved on simple program swapping numbers.
2. Accepting three numbers from user and print that maximum number 
3. I have started with the Python list data type. Following operations get performed on a list. 
About list: 
    * list is the most frequently used very versatile datatype.
    * In single list may contain data types like integer, string, object
    * A list is mutable,hence we can alter even after its creation.

list is considered as array which contains heterogenous data
   1. hetrogeneous
   2. Ordered
   3. Indexed
   4. Mutable
   5. Allows Duplicated

Foolwing operation are performed on list - 

      1. Insert- Adding element at a particular index
      2. Append - Adding element at the end of list
      3. del  - deleting element 
      4. sort - if list is homogeneous then sort will perform.
      5. pop - it will remove the last element
      6. remove- it will remove the passed item to remove function
