Pytest 

#1. Basics of pytest:   [Refer: test_BasicFirst.py ]

  * pytest is a Python testing framework based on Python.
  * Installing pytest:   pip install pytest
  * Running pytest without mentioning the filename will run all files if format test_*.py,_test.py in the current directory or subdirectories.
  * Pytest automatically identifies those files as test files.
  * Any code should be wrapped in the method.

# How to run test cases using command prompt:
      * for running a test case using the command prompt you have to use the following command:
            command: py.test

      * If you have to run multiple commands at a time then you can use the following command:
        Step1: go to that path where your at test files are saved
        
            command : py.test -v

      * if you want to see the full result then you can use the following command:

            Command: py. test -v -s

# In pytest if you want to compare two things you have to use assert   

#2.  How to Run one test case and another test case from another file        [Refer: test_demo.py , test_demo2.py ]
   * For this you have to use a command as follows:

          Command:   py. test -k [(name of the method) which is the same for all the methods]  -v -s

                     -k:  executing method name 
                     -v:  Displaying logs of output
                     -s:  more information about metadata
