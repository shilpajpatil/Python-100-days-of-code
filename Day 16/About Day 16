Pytest 
  * pytest is a python testing framework based on python.
  * Installing pytest  :   pip install pytest
  * Running pytest without mentioning filename will run all files if format test_*.py ,_test.py in the current directory or subdirectories.
  * Pytest automatically identifies those files as test files.
  * Any code should be wrapped in method.

#---how to run test cases using command prompt:
      * for running a test case using command prompt you have to used following command:
            command : py.test

      * If you have to run multiple commands at a time then you can use following command:
        Step1: go to that path where your at the testfiles are saved
        
            command :py.test -v

      * if you want to see full result then you can use the following command:

            Command : py.test -v -s

# In pytest if you want to compare two things you have to use assert
