1.Main.py I have used Module from python 
	-> A file containing Python code, for e.g.: Addition.py, is called a module and its module 
	   name would be Addition. 
	-> We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized 
	   files. 
	-> Modules provide reusability of code. 
	-> We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying 
	   their definitions into different programs.
	-> To import our defined module Addition we type the following in the Python 
		prompt. 
 		import Addition
	->This does not enter the names of the functions defined in example directly in the current 
	  symbol table. 
	->It only enters the module name example there. 
	-> Using the module name we can access the function using dot (.) operation. 
	   Addition    .   addition()

	     (moduleName)   (Function Name)


2. Accept two list from user and check these two list are identical or not:
3. Number guessing game
4.Python tuple module.
   Tuple - We cannot change the elements of tuple when it is get assigned.
          -Tuple is used for hecterogeneous data.
          - Tuple are immutable hence itereating through tuple is faster.
  
*Heterogeneous
*Ordered
*Indexed 
*Immutable
