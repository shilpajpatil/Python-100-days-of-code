Day 3 starts with reversing a user-created list.

Start with leap year :
    -> To find leap year you have to check three conditions. 
    -> If a year is divisible by 4, it's a potential leap year.
    -> If it's divisible by 100, it might not be a leap year (unless the next condition is true).  
    -> If it's divisible by 400, it is a leap year.

Check whether the number is palindrome or not :
    -> A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. 

Explore the set:
     -> A set is unordered collection of items.
     -> Every element is unique.
     -> immutable (which cannot change)
     -> set itself is mutable. we can add or remove items from it. 

Characteristics:
    * Hetrogeneous
    * unordered
    * unindexed
    * Immutable 
    * Duplicate not allowed.
