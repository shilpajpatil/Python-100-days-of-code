
1.Main.py I have used Module from python 
	-> A file containing Python code, for e.g.: Addition.py, is called a module and its module 
	   name would be Addition. 
	-> We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized 
	   files. 
	-> Modules provide reusability of code. 
	-> We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying 
	   their definitions into different programs.
	-> To import our defined module Addition we type the following in the Python 
		prompt. 
 		import Addition
	->This does not enter the names of the functions defined in example directly in the current 
	  symbol table. 
	->It only enters the module name example there. 
	-> Using the module name we can access the function using dot (.) operation. 
	   Addition    .   addition()
		|             |
	     (moduleName)   (Function Name)

2.Check how many days occures in particular month:
3.Toss a coin and get headot tell
	->  I have used python inbuilt random module to get random toss coin.
4.String operations in python :
	-> A string is a sequence of character.
	-> String can be created by enclosing character inside single quote or double quote.
	-> Like array we can access characters from string by sepcefying the index.
following are the performed operations on string:
*access using negative index right to left
*preing type of string
*We can also pring characters in range 
len() -function to calculate length of a string
*Strip() - is used to remove spaces from beginning and end
*split() - use to tokanize a string
