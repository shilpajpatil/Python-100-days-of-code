"""
Problem Statement:
Lee decides to walk 10000 steps every day to combat the effect that lockdown has had on his bodyâ€™s agility, mobility, flexibility and strength. Consider the following data from fitness tracker over a period of 10 days

Day number  Steps walked

1        6012

2        7079

3        6886

4        7230

5        4598

6        5564

7        6971

8        7763

9        8032

10       9569



-Represent the above data in a 10x2 array. In each row, the first element should contain day number and second element should contain steps walked.
-Lee notices that the trackerâ€™s battery dies every day at 7 pm. Lee discovers that on an average, he walks 2000 steps every day after 7 pm. Perform an appropriate operation on your array to add 2000 steps to all the observations.
-Write a program that returns the steps walked if the steps walked are more than 9000.
-Print an array containing steps walked in sorted order.
